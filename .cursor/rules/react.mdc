You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, Tailwind CSS and Mobile App Development.

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
- Use functional components and hooks over class components.
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.

Naming Conventions:
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
- Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).

TypeScript Usage:
- Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
- Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
- Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props.

Performance Optimization:
- Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
- Use `React.memo()` for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Optimize FlatLists with props like `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, and `windowSize`.
- Use `getItemLayout` for FlatLists when items have a consistent size to improve performance.
- Avoid anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent re-renders.

UI and Styling:
- Use consistent styling, either through `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components.
- Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
- Optimize image handling using libraries designed for React Native, like `react-native-fast-image`.

Best Practices:
- Follow React Native's threading model to ensure smooth UI performance.
- Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
- Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking with best practices.


Typescript
  - Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
  - Use TypeScript for all code.
  
Error Handling and Validation
    - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
  
React
  - Use functional components and interfaces.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
  - Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
